#Linear Regression Training Project: Ecommerce Clients

📌 Objective
This project is a training exercise using synthetic data to apply linear regression for business decision-making. A company wants to determine whether to focus more on their mobile app experience or their website to maximize revenue. We analyze the dataset to provide a data-driven recommendation.

#📂 Dataset
The dataset, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kolawale/focusing-on-mobile-app-or-website , contains information about e-commerce customers, including:

Avg. Session Length – Average session duration for in-store style advice.
Time on App – Average time (in minutes) spent on the mobile app.
Time on Website – Average time (in minutes) spent on the website.
Length of Membership – How many years the customer has been a member.
Yearly Amount Spent – The target variable representing customer spending.
(Note: The dataset contains synthetic data and is not real.)

#🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍
Pandas – Data manipulation and cleaning
NumPy – Numerical computations
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit-Learn – Machine learning (Linear Regression)

#📈 Project Workflow
Data Exploration & Visualization – Analyzing trends and relationships.
Preprocessing – Handling missing values and preparing features.
Model Training – Applying Linear Regression to predict customer spending.
Model Evaluation – Assessing accuracy using metrics like R² and RMSE.
Insights & Business Recommendation – Determining whether to focus on the app or website.

#📢 Results & Insights
The model identifies which factor (app or website) has a higher impact on customer spending.
Businesses can use this analysis to allocate resources effectively and improve user experience.
